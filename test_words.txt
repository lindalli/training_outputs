concluded
in

that

Because

--

geometrical
figures

measurement

Mr.

*T*-1

the

In

the

But
anti-abortionists
oppose
such
research
because

worry

development

therapies
using
fetal-tissue
transplants
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
abortions
.
James

be
issued
*-1
soon
in

a
letter
to

Both
Dr.

oppose

as
does
President
Bush
*?*
,
except
in
cases
where
a

's
life
is
threatened
*-2
*T*-1

The
controversy
began
in
1987
when
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
,
aware
of
the
policy
implications
of
its
research
,
asked
for
an
HHS
review
of
its
plan
*
to
implant
fetal
tissue
into
the
brain
of
a
patient
suffering
from
Parkinson
's
disease
*T*-1
.
The
department
placed
a
moratorium
on
the
research
,
*
pending
a
review
of
scientific
,
legal
and
ethical
issues
.
A
majority
of
an
NIH-appointed
panel
recommended
late
last
year
that
the
research
continue
under
carefully
controlled
conditions
,
but
the
issue
became
embroiled
*-2
in
politics
as
anti-abortion
groups
continued
*-3
to
oppose
federal
funding
.
The
dispute
has
hampered
the
administration
's
efforts

to
recruit
prominent
doctors
0
*T*-1
to
fill
prestigious
posts
at
the
helm
of
the
NIH
and
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
.
Several
candidates
have
withdrawn
their
names
from
consideration
after
administration
officials
asked
them
for
their
views
on
abortion
and
fetal-tissue
transplants
.
Antonio
Novello
,
whom
Mr.
Bush
nominated
*T*-113
to
serve
as
surgeon
general
,
reportedly
has
assured

that
she
opposes
abortion
.
Dr.
Novello
is
deputy
director
of
the
National
Institute
of
Child
Health
and
Human
Development
.
Some
researchers
have
charged
that
the
administration
is
imposing
new
ideological
tests
for
top
scientific
posts
.
Earlier
this
week
,
Dr.
Sullivan
tried
*-1
to
defuse
these
charges
by
*-4
stressing
that
candidates
0
*T*-2

head
the
NIH
and
the

will
be
judged
*-3
by
``
standards

scientific
and
administrative
excellence
,
''
not
politics
.
But
the
administration
's
handling
of
the
fetal-tissue
transplant
issue
disturbs
many
scientists
.
``
When
scientific
progress
moves
into
uncharted
ground
*T*-1

there
has
*-3

be
a
role

judgments
about

applications

''
says
*T*-2
Myron
Genel
,
associate
dean
of
the
Yale
Medical
School
.
``
The
disturbing
thing
about
this

become
polarized

so
that
no

for

finding
a
middle
ground
.
Yale
is
one
of
the
few
medical
institutions
conducting
privately
funded
research
on
fetal-tissue
transplants
.
But
Dr.
Genel
warns
that
Dr.
Mason
's
ruling
may
discourage
private
funding
.
``
The
unavailability
of
federal
funds
,
and
the
climate
in
which
the
decision
was
made

*T*-1
,
certainly
do
n't
provide
any
incentive
for
one
of
the
more
visible
foundations
to
provide
support
,
''
he
said
*T*-3
.
Despite
the
flap
over
transplants
,
federal
funding
of
research
involving
fetal
tissues
will
continue
on
a
number
of
fronts
.
``
Such
research
may
ultimately
result
in
the
ability

regenerate

warnings

issued

to
at

100
criminal

attorneys
in
several
major
cities
in

last

,
have
led
to
an
outcry
by
members
of
the
organized
bar
,
who
*T*-125
claim
0
the
information
is
protected
*-1
by
attorney-client
privilege
.
The
IRS
warnings
stem
from
a
1984
law
that
*T*-1
requires
anyone
who
*T*-126
receives
more
than
$
10,000
*U*
in
cash
from
a
client
or
customer
in
one
or
more
related
transactions
``
in
the
course
of
trade
or
business
''
to
report
the
payment
on
a
document
known
*
as
Form
8300
.
The
form
asks
for
such
details
as
the
client
's
name
,
Social
Security
number
,
passport
number
and
details
about
the
services
provided
*
for
the
payment
.
Failure
*
to
complete
the
form
had
been
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor
until
last
November
,
when
Congress
determined
that
the
crime
was
a
felony
punishable
by
up
to
10
years
in
prison
*T*-1
.
Attorneys
have
argued
since
1985
,
when
the
law
took
effect
*T*-1
,
that
they
can
not
provide
information
about
clients
who
*T*-127
do

wish

identities
to
be
known

Many
attorneys
have
returned
incomplete
forms
to

IRS
in

,
*-1
citing
attorney-client
privilege

Until

the

rarely
acted

``
This
form
forces
a
lawyer
to
become

Neal

Sonnett

president

Lawyers

``
The

is
asking

added
Mr.
Sonnett
,
a
Miami
lawyer
who
*T*-128
has
heard
from
dozens
of
attorneys

*T*-129
received

in
recent
days
and
has
himself
received
the
computer-generated
IRS
forms
sent
*
by
certified

Mr.
Sonnett
said
that
clients
who
*T*-130
pay
cash
may
include
alleged
drug
dealers
who
*T*-131
do
n't
have
domestic
bank
accounts
.
These
individuals
may
not
necessarily
be
under
investigation
when
they
hire
lawyers
*T*-1
.
Mr.
Sonnett
said
0
there
also
may
be
other
circumstances
under
which
individuals
would
n't
want
the
government
to
know
0
they
had
retained
criminal
defense
lawyers
*T*-1
.
*
Filling
out
detailed
forms
about
these

would
tip

IRS
off

spark
action

The

Michael
Ross
,
a
New

lawyer
who
*T*-132
heads
the
ABA

the
client
from

committing
a
criminal
act
that
*T*-2
could
result
in
death

Mr.
Ross
said
0
he
met

Justice
Department
,
which
*T*-133
would
bring
any
enforcement
actions

discuss
the
issue
last
May

At

he
said
0
*T*-1

the
Justice
Department
assured
him
that
enforcement
procedures
would
n't
be
threatened
*-2
against
attorneys
without
further
review
and
advance
notice
.
Mr.
Ross

IRS
officials

But
in
the
letters
sent
*
in
recent

,
Christopher
J.
Lezovich
of
the
IRS
computing
center
in
Detroit
,
told
attorneys
that
``

failing

the
requested
information

result

summons
enforcement
action
being
initiated

In
some
cases
,
the
IRS
asked
for
information
dating
back
to
forms
0
it
received
*T*-1
in

A

for
the

confirmed
that

there
has

about

Individuals

policy
said
that
Justice
officials
had

any
knowledge

Lawyers
worry
that
if
they
provide
information
about
clients
,
that
data
could
quickly
end
up
in
the
hands
of
prosecutors
.
Prosecutors
need
court
permission
*-1

obtain
the
tax
returns
of
an
individual

a
business

But
they
have
obtained
8300
forms
without
court
permission
and
used
the
information
*-1
to
help
develop
criminal
cases
.
Some
criminal
lawyers
speculated
that
the
IRS
was
sending
the
letters
*-1
to
test
the
issue

In

``

the

of
